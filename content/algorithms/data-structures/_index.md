Data structures play a major role in many algoritmic tasks. This is also true for coding interviews because very often you will need to be able to use one or more data structures to build a correct and efficient solution. If you are confident in using these data structures this will help you tremendouly at your interviews. Some of the most freqeuently used ones are:

* Array (also represented as list or vector in some languages)
* Linked List
* Stack
* Queue
* Tree
* Graph
* Set
* Map

This is not an extensive list of all data structures but we think it covers the most essential ones, which you would need to know very well. We will gradually add content to cover them with lessons inside of this section.
