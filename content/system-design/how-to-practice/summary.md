In this section we discussed several strategies for practicing system design questions. By combining discussing solutions with friends or coworkers with reading about scalable real-world systems and doing mock interviews, youâ€™d be able to develop strong system design chops.

Our recommendation is to start by working on system design questions yourself, then move on to discussing designs with friends, to finally doing mock interviews.

To help you with finding good examples of system design questions we have prepared the next sections of this course. They will present you with several example questions. Then for each question you will see a detailed discussions about how it could be solved at an interview.

Good luck and enjoy!
