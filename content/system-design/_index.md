Tech interviewers will often ask you to design on the whiteboard a complicated software system in 15 minutes. How is that even possible? Sometimes you would get asked to design a major feature from a system like Twitter or Facebook from scratch, for example. But these systems were built over a long period of time by big teams of engineers, you would say.

In this course you will see what such system design interview questions look like and what is expected from you in order to solve them.

Interviewees have a number of common problems when facing such interview questions. Some approach the questions in a chaotic way and fail to build a complete and solid design. Others lack solid understanding of how to properly design architectures that scale.

We'll teach you more about designing scalable software systems through examples. We will also teach you some strategies for presenting your knowledge and skills in the best possible way.
