        <p>When most people receive an offer, they deal with it as if it were binary: they either take it or leave it. This is crazy!</p>
        <p>Once you've been extended an offer, the fun part of negotiating your salary and benefits starts. Do you have offers from more than one company? Even better!</p>
        <p>While we could create a whole other course on salary negotiation, we'd like to point you to a website that contains some useful content on this topic: <a href="http://candor.co/" target="_blank">Candor</a>. There is some free advice on this site that can get you started.</p>
        <p>The point is, don't just compare offers on face value: think about how you can negotiate a good deal for yourself.</p>
        <p>And best of all, investing some time in learning the basics of successful negotiation will not only increase your chances of getting adequate compensation. It will also make you a better friend, spouse, parent, and person.</p>

        <p>Many people wonder if they could ever get a job at a company where they got rejected. The answer is certainly yes unless you offended someone, for example. Of course, don't expect to apply again after a short period of time like a few weeks. But certainly this should be possible again after a number of months or a year, especially if you think something substantial has changed in your skills.</p>
        <p>You may need to give a reason about why you are applying again sometimes. Once you decide to apply again you can contact your recruiter. You can say that you've learned and practiced a lot since the last time, if that's true, and that you want to try again.</p>
        <p>So, if rejected once don't feel sad at all. There will be new opportunities in the future.</p>
